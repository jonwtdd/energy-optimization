# Household Energy Optimization

For a group project, my partner and I focused on analyzing, predicting, and optimizing household energy use with data from over two million observations collected over about four years. After cleaning and preparing the data by scaling and normalizing it, I built a sequential neural network to predict energy consumption. I also examined feature importance to identify key factors affecting energy use and used the model to explore ways to reduce consumption by targeting the most influential factors.
